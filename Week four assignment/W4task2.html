    <p>The gameplay of PUBG Mobile is similar to that of the original PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Players parachute down to a lonely island and compete to be the last man remaining, either alone or in teams of two or four, depending on the game option chosen before to the battle. Each battle lasts around 30 minutes.

        The game begins with the players flying in an aircraft over one of several different maps, which are also chosen prior to the contest. Players pick where to parachute down as they go across the globe. When the jet lands, a blue border forms around the island's perimeter, denoting the boundary between the safe zone and the external blue zone.The safe zone shrinks every few minutes, and anybody who remains in it will gradually lose health, maybe to the point of death. When the safe zone shrinks, the rate of health loss increases.

        When players initially arrive on the island, they must gather food and weapons in their surroundings or plunder them from dead players. Better weaponry and equipment are often located in more hazardous areas of the game.In addition to the constant decreasing of the safe zone, brief red zones may occur at random to be bombarded with explosives, and the plane may occasionally fly over the battlefield to drop a package with unusual equipment, maybe including items not seen elsewhere on the island. To provide fair warning, all of these extraordinary occurrences, including the typical safe zone shrinkage, are notified to the players prior to their occurrence.Log-in bonuses, objectives and micro-goals, crew recruiting, map and compass upgrades with larger and clear markings near teammates, an auto loot system, and an increased number of bots are among the additional features exclusive to the mobile edition of PUBG.</p>
